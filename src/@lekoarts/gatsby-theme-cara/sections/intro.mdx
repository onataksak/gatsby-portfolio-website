# Hi, I'm Nurettin Onat Aksak

I am a Computer Engineering student and a developer for Mobile applications. From the beginning of my programming journey, I always wanted to create stuff that are easily accessible and fun. Currently I am also learning Web Development. After finishing this website I will be posting some web applications as well. I also play drums professionally, so feel free to contact me if you would like to do some jam sessions!
