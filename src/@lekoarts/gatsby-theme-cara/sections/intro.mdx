# Hi, I'm Nurettin Onat Aksak

I am a Computer Engineering student and a mobile applications developer for the Android platform. Here you can check out some of my work I did so far. Currently I am also learning Web Development. After finishing this website I will be posting some web applications as well. I also play drums professionally, so feel free to contact me if you would like to do some jam sessions!
