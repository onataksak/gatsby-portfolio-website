# Hi, I'm Nurettin Onat Aksak

I am a Computer Engineering student and a developer for Mobile applications. It feels great to create stuff that are easily accessible, like via our phones. Currently I am also learning Web Development. Soon I will be posting some web applications as well. I also play drums professionally, so feel free to contact me if you would like to do some jam sessions!
